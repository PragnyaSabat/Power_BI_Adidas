# Retail Customer Retention Analytics – ADIDAS
Problem Statement & Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
## 1️⃣ Problem Statement
### 1.1 Business Context

Adidas operates across retail stores, franchise outlets, and online platforms globally. Despite having extensive customer transaction and loyalty data, the organization lacks a centralized analytical framework to:

Identify customers who are likely to churn

Measure retention and repeat behavior accurately

Evaluate loyalty tier effectiveness

Assess promotion impact on revenue and churn

Compare performance across store types and channels

Identify high-value customers for strategic retention

The absence of consolidated analytics restricts Adidas from executing data-driven retention strategies and improving customer lifetime value.

### 1.2 Core Business Problems

Customer Churn Uncertainty

No consolidated KPI to measure churn rate.

Lack of segmentation of churned vs active customers.

Retention & Repeat Purchase Gap

No structured analysis of repeat behavior.

No tier-based purchase frequency segmentation.

Loyalty Program Inefficiency

Unclear relationship between points earned and redeemed.

No measurement of churn rate across loyalty tiers.

Promotion Effectiveness Ambiguity

Uncertain impact of promotions on purchase value.

No comparison between promotional vs non-promotional transactions.

Store & Channel Performance Variability

No unified analysis of store type performance.

Unknown relationship between store maturity and retention.

Lack of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Segmentation

No systematic CLV calculation.

No identification of high-value customers.

### 1.3 Objective

To design and develop a multi-page Power BI Customer Retention Dashboard that:

Consolidates multiple datasets

Builds actionable KPIs

Enables dynamic segmentation

Identifies high-value and at-risk customers

Supports strategic business decisions

## 2️⃣ Dataset Overview

As described in the project document 

C3_Project_ Adidas Retail Custo…

, the following datasets were used:

Customer_Demographics

Customer_Transactions

Store_Locations

Loyalty_Program

Churn_Labelled_Customers

These datasets were integrated through Customer_ID and Store_ID relationships.

## 3️⃣ Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
### Task 1: Data Modeling & Cleaning
#### Step 1: Data Import

Loaded all CSV files into Power BI.

Opened Power Query Editor.

#### Step 2: Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate Customer_ID entries.

Checked for missing values.

Corrected data types:

Date columns → Date type

Amount → Decimal

Categorical fields → Text

#### Step 3: Created Calculated Columns

Membership Duration

Membership_Duration = 
DATEDIFF(Membership_Since, TODAY(), YEAR)


Extracted Transaction Year

Transaction_Year = YEAR(Transaction_Date)


Extracted Transaction Month

Transaction_Month = FORMAT(Transaction_Date, "MMM")

#### Step 4: Data Modeling

Created relationships:

Customer_Demographics ↔ Transactions

Transactions ↔ Store_Locations

Customer ↔ Loyalty_Program

Customer ↔ Churn_Labelled_Customers

### Task 2: Churn & Retention Metrics
#### Step 1: Total Customers
Total_Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Customer_ID)

#### Step 2: Churned Customers
Churned_Customers =
CALCULATE(
COUNTROWS(Churn_Labelled_Customers),
Churn_Flag = 1
)

#### Step 3: Churn Rate KPI
Churn_Rate = 
DIVIDE([Churned_Customers], [Total_Customers], 0) * 100

#### Step 4: Visualizations

Clustered column charts:

Churn by Region

Churn by Income Level

Churn by Loyalty Tier

Churn by Channel

Funnel Chart:

Total → Repeat → Churned

### Task 3: Repeat Purchase Analysis
#### Step 1: Calculate Transaction Count
Transaction_Count = COUNT(Transaction_ID)

#### Step 2: Customer Segmentation

0–3 → Low Tier

4–8 → Mid Tier

9+ → High Tier

#### Step 3: Comparative Analysis

Avg purchase frequency by:

Region

Age Group

Loyalty Tier

#### Step 4: Category Insights

Identified top product categories among loyal customers.

### Task 4: Promotion & Loyalty Impact
#### Step 1: Promotion Percentage
Promotion_Percentage =
DIVIDE(
COUNTROWS(FILTER(Transactions, Promotion_Applied = "Yes")),
COUNTROWS(Transactions)
) * 100

#### Step 2: Comparative Metrics

Avg Purchase Amount:

With Promotion

Without Promotion

#### Step 3: Loyalty Analysis

Churn by Loyalty Tier

Points Earned vs Redeemed by Tier

#### Step 4: Derived Recommendations

Improve redemption balance

Reward repeat behavior

Target elite tier churn risk

### Task 5: Store & Channel Performance
#### Step 1: Merge Store Data

Joined Store_Locations with Transactions via Store_ID.

#### Step 2: Metrics Created

Avg Transaction by Store Type

Churn Rate by Store Type

Correlation:

Store Opening Year vs Retention Rate

#### Step 3: Insights

Mature stores show stronger retention patterns.

Franchise stores contribute high-value segments.

### Task 6: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
#### Step 1: CLV Calculation
CLV = 
DIVIDE(Total_Spend, Membership_Duration, 0)

#### Step 2: CLV Segmentation

Low CLV

Medium CLV

High CLV

#### Step 3: CLV Visualizations

CLV vs Days Since Last Purchase

CLV by Loyalty Tier

CLV by Region

### Task 7: Dashboard Development
